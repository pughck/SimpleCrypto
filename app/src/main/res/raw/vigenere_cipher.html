    For <em>Vigen&#233;re Cipher</em>, the key for the encryption is a vector, chosen by the
    description below.
</p>
<p>
    We first choose a key length, 6 as an example. Then choose a vector of this size whose
    entries are integers from 0 to 25. Given an example, we have the <em>k</em> = (21, 4, 2, 19,
    14, 17). The key often corresponds to a word that is easily remembered. We build the word
    <em>vector</em> in this example.

<p>
    The security of the system depends on the fact that neither the keyword nor its length is
    known.
