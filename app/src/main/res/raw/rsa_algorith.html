    <strong>RSA</strong> is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely
    used for secure data transmission. The encryption key is public, and is very different from
    the decryption key. The four steps in doing the RSA algorithm involved 4 different steps:
    <strong>key generation</strong>, <strong>key distribution</strong>, <strong>encryption
</strong>, and <strong>decryption</strong>.
