The Caesar Cipher, also known as Shift Cipher, is considered one of the earliest cryptosystems. The cryposystem is often attributed to Julius Caesar. This was during the time Julius Caesar wanted to send a message but did not want Brutus to read it. To protect the plain text, each character in the alphabet was shifted by a certain amount, making the next look like gibberish. Thus hiding the message and people not thinking anything of it.

The way the system works is by using modular arithmetic. For more information on modular arithmetic, please refer to the lessons page about modular arithmetic. 

Label the alphabet, starting at zero to the end of the alphabet. So, for the English alphabet, the numbering would be 0 to 25, with <em>a</em> being number 0 and <em>z</em> being number 25. To encrypt the string of character, take the corresponding character and transform into a number and add the shift factor to produce the new number that represents the character. If the number goes pass the end, use modular arithmetic with the length of the alphabet to wrapped around to the beginning. 

The encryption formula would be

<em>x &#8594; x + k (mod a) </em>

where <em>k</em> is the shift factor and <em>a</em> is the length of the alphabet. 

The encryption formula would be 

<em>x &#8594; x - k (mod a) </em>

where <em>k</em> is the shift factor and <em>a</em> is the length of the alphabet again.

To attack the cryptosystem, there are four different types of attacks: Ciphertext only, Known plaintext, Chosen plaintext, and Chosen ciphertext. 

<strong>Cipher only</strong>
	If only given ciphertext, a brute force search is required to make the message into something readable. To do so, every possible shift factor must be done on the string, and find a meaningful message in the string.
	
<strong>Known plaintext</strong>
	If you know just one letter plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, then decrypting the message is simple, since all other letters will have the same shift factor.
	
<strong>Chosen plaintext</strong>
	Give the system a single plaintext letter, then the output will be ciphertext, and find the difference in values will give the key.

<strong>Chosen ciphertext</strong>
	Give the system a single ciphertext letter, the system will output the plaintext, then you can find the negative of the key.
